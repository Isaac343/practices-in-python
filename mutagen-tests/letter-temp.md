I'm the Scatman  
(Scatting by Scatman John)  
I'm the Scatman  (Scatting by Scatman John)  

Everybody stutters one way or the other  
So check out my message to you.  
As a matter of fact don't let nothin' hold you back.  
If the Scatman can do it so can you.

Everybody's sayin' that the Scatman stutters  
But doesn't ever stutter when he sings.  
But what you don't know I'm gonna tell you right now  
That the stutter and the scat is the same thing.  
Yo I'm the Scatman.    
Where's the Scatman? I'm the Scatman.    
Why should we be pleasin' all the politician heathens  
Who would try to change the seasons if the could?  
The state of the condition insults my intuitions  
And it only makes me crazy and my heart like wood.    
Everybody stutters one way or the other  
So check out my message to you.  
As a matter of fact don't let nothin' hold you back.  
If the Scatman can do it brother so can you.  
I'm the Scatman.    
(Scatting by Scatman John)   
 Everybody stutters one way or the other  
 So check out my message to you.  
 As a matter of fact don't let nothin' hold you back.  
 If the Scatman can do it brother so can you.    
 I hear you all ask 'bout the meaning of scat.
  Well I'm the professor and all I can tell you is  
  While you're still sleepin' the saints are still weepin' cause  
  Things you call dead haven't yet had the chance to be born.  
  I'm the Scatman.    
  (Scatting by Scatman John)  
  I'm the Scatman....repeat after me  It's a scoobie oobie doobie scoobie doobie melody  
  I'm the Scatman....sing along with me  
  It's a scoobie oobie doobie scoobie doobie melody  (Scatting by Scatman John)
